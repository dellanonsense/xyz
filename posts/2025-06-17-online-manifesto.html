        <p> hello. hello! </p>
        <p> my online presence has dwindled into virtually nothing, and that’s probably a good thing. not to say I’m “returning”, but! getting re-organized (but not, because I want to be more comfortable here). </p>
        <p> so! online manifesto. </p>
        <p> I essentially want to use this website and my coordinating online presence to have fun and express myself. I claim I want to inspire others with my works (and I do!) but it’s much more of a selfish intention to decorate as I see fit. </p>
        <p> as a self-proclaimed “restless creative”, I do a lot with very little output. my sns is predominantly artwork and illustration related, but has been more of a marketing of myself than fun. at least that’s what my view of it has become. I hope to change that. the art I create doesn’t lean itself well to being “professional” or “sane”, so I shouldn’t try to wrap it up in that image. </p>
        <p> I’ve given up on making money from my art, and I think that might be beneficial to my mindset. aside from illustrations, I’ve delved into storytelling, poetry and gamedev. nothing much has come of it, but that’s ok! whatever I make or do, it has a place here if I want to share it. </p>
        <p> I don’t want notoriety or fame, not anymore. I just want to be here and have fun, and if that means unbothered, so be it! this website and my internet are not diaries, but spaces I can design and live in. and I want to have fun, let loose a little (while staying safe!) and make sure my hobbies don’t get drowned out by reality. </p>
        <p> anyways. </p>

        <h2> ‚ô° lore ‚ô° </h2>
        <p> l‚Äôatelier was a laboratory studying cyber-organic mutations, lead by a scientist and his church-appointed assistant. she was an android named della. </p>
        <p> overtime, the cold android felt the experiments were wrong; in return, the scientist she trusted most made her a test subject. </p>
        <p> as l‚Äôatelier rotted, and everyone left, della remained in her mangled, distorted state. </p>
        <p> she was doomed to eventually go offline and be one of the other desecrated bodies, until with a burst of pink light- all of l‚Äôatelier disappeared. </p>
        <p> now there are rumors of a chapel wandering the void. some say it used to be a laboratory. android nuns walk the halls and chambers seeking art, music, stories and expression. all of them bearing a striking resemblance to the scientist‚Äôs assistant, della. </p>
        <p> the ‚Äúdella‚Äù you see is one such android. </p>
